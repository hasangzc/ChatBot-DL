# ChatBot-DL
Create a chatbot using Deep learning

Created a simple chatbot with Keras in this code. 
The created Json file was edited in the datapreprocessing.py file and made ready for the deeplearnin model.

With the functions written in the prod.py file, the user can now use the HHG-Bot.
You can access the details about the model from the model.py file.

You can move the bot to discord by running the discordbot.py file :)

Some screenshots from Discord:
